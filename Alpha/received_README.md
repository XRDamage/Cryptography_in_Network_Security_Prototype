# Cryptography_in_Network_Security
## Problem Statement: 
Networks are used by all individuals and organizations (Internet, LAN, WAN). The security of these networks is of utmost importance. The network security protocols play a massive role in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data transmitted over networks. These protocols are still not immune to vulnerabilities and can be exploited by malicious parties to compromise the security of the network.
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyse existing network protocols, such as TLS, IPsec, or SSH. The analysis will involve identifying vulnerabilities in these protocols and then propose improvements with the use of cryptography.
## Methodology:
1. Background and feasibility research. 2. Protocol analysis.
3. Design and implementation of prototype. 4. Analysing and improving prototype. 5. Implementing final version on the network. 6. Evaluation of the improvements to network security. Outcomes:
1. Identify vulnerabilities of existing network security protocols. 2. Propose improvements or new protocols to address the vulnerabilities. 3. Implement the proposed network security improvements.
4. Evaluation of the improvement’s effectiveness in network security. Skills required:
• Solid understanding of cryptography and network security protocols. • Programming skills in Python or C.
• Familiarity with network simulation tools like NS-3.
## Conclusion:
This project aims to contribute to the field of network security by analysing and improving existing protocols, or new protocols to enhance network security. By identifying vulnerabilities in network security protocols, this project has the potential to improve the overall security of network communications
